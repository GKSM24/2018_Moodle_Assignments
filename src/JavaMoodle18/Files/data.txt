Some editors are programmable, meaning, e.g., they can be customized for specific uses.
With a programmable editor it is easy to automate repetitive tasks or, add new functionality or even implement a new application within the framework of the editor.
One common motive for customizing is to make a text editor use the commands of another text editor with which the user is more familiar, or to duplicate missing functionality the user has come to depend on.
Software developers often use editor customizations tailored to the programming language or development environment they are working in.
